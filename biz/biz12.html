<h1>IT Change Management Discussion</h1>

<p>
[Discussion material in English. Based on GTAG “IT Change Management (3rd Edition)”.]
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Core idea:</strong> Change management is a repeatable and auditable way to protect the <strong>production environment</strong>
  while implementing technology changes (including patches). It reduces unplanned work, limits unintended outcomes, and improves service quality.
</div>

<!-- ===================== Quick Overview ===================== -->
<h2>What “Change Management” Covers (GTAG Summary)</h2>

<p>
In IT, change management is the systematic process to manage enhancements, updates, installations, fixes, configuration changes, and <strong>patches</strong>
to production systems — while minimizing disruption and controlling risk.
</p>

<div class="badges">
  <span class="badge">Repeatable process</span>
  <span class="badge">Approval & authorization</span>
  <span class="badge">Segregation of duties</span>
  <span class="badge">Migration across environments</span>
  <span class="badge">Patches as standard changes</span>
  <span class="badge">Metrics & continuous improvement</span>
</div>

<!-- ===================== Configuration Management ===================== -->
<h2>Configuration Management — Discussion Points</h2>

<p>
Even though the GTAG explicitly says it does not deep-dive into configuration management,
effective change management still depends on configuration discipline:
knowing <strong>what exists</strong>, <strong>what changed</strong>, <strong>who changed it</strong>, and <strong>when</strong>.
</p>

<div class="mini-card">
  <h3>Why Config Mgmt Matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Link each production change to an approved request/ticket.</li>
    <li><strong>Version control:</strong> Ensure only approved versions of code/config are promoted.</li>
    <li><strong>Baseline & rollback:</strong> Maintain known-good baselines to restore service quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Auditability:</strong> Evidence that changes are authorized and not manipulated.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="note">
What Does (DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD) Mean?

(DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD) represents the standard environment flow that IT changes
(such as code, configuration, or patches) follow before reaching the live system.
It describes the migration path used to protect the production environment.

DEV (Development Environment)
This is where developers create and modify code.
Changes are frequent, and the environment is used for building and initial experimentation.

TEST (Testing Environment)
This environment is used to verify that the change works technically as expected.
It includes unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing to identify defects.

UAT (User Acceptance Testing Environment)
This is where business users (not IT) confirm that the change meets business requirements.
For example, the finance team verifies that accounting postings or reports behave correctly.

PROD (Production Environment)
This is the live environment used by real users and customers.
Any error here can directly impact operations, financial reporting, or security.

Why Is This Flow Important?

The main purpose of separating environments is to protect the production system.
Allowing changes to move directly from DEV to PROD without testing or approval
significantly increases the risk of system outages, data integrity issues, and security incidents.

Each step in the flow acts as a control gate, ensuring that:

the change is properly tested,

the change is formally approved,

and the change is deployed by authorized personnel only.

This environment separation is a core concept in change management and migration controls,
and it directly supports segregation of duties and auditability.
</p>

<!-- ===================== Migration ===================== -->
<h2>Migration (DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD) — Discussion Points</h2>

<p>
GTAG highlights that systems typically have multiple environments (DEV/TEST/UAT/PROD),
and the controlled movement of a change across environments is called <strong>migration</strong>.
A key control is <strong>segregation of duties</strong> so developers cannot directly deploy to production.
</p>

<div class="mini-card">
  <h3>Good Migration Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Environment consistency:</strong> Keep TEST/UAT as identical as possible to PROD (versions, patches, configs).</li>
    <li><strong>SoD in promotion:</strong> Developers build changes; an independent role (e.g., release manager) migrates to PROD.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-production testing:</strong> Mandatory evidence of testing before PROD approval.</li>
    <li><strong>Verification after deployment:</strong> Confirm success + confirm the process was followed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Step</th>
  <th>Migration Gate</th>
  <th>Typical Evidence</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>DEV → TEST</strong></td>
  <td>Basic technical validation</td>
  <td>Build logs, unit tests, peer review</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>TEST → UAT</strong></td>
  <td>Business readiness</td>
  <td>Test results, defect closure, UAT plan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>UAT → PROD</strong></td>
  <td>Formal authorization & SoD</td>
  <td>CAB approval, deployment ticket, access profiles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Post-PROD</strong></td>
  <td>Validate impact</td>
  <td>Monitoring, PIR (post-implementation review), outage analysis</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<!-- ===================== Patch Management ===================== -->
<h2>Patches as Part of Change Management</h2>

<p>
GTAG treats <strong>patches</strong> as a category of change that should follow the normal change management process.
Patches can be urgent (security vulnerabilities), complex, and sometimes “pushed” automatically by vendors — which adds risk.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Patch reality check:</strong> Even “successful” patch deployment can cause unintended outages.
  That’s why GTAG recommends testing patches in a staging/sandbox environment when possible, and managing them in a planned cycle.
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk-based prioritization:</strong> Critical vulnerabilities need faster timelines.</li>
  <li><strong>Bundle & schedule:</strong> More efficient than patching one-by-one without coordination.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor push awareness:</strong> IT should know when patches may auto-apply and plan monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ===================== Practical Dialogue ===================== -->
<h2>Practical Dialogue: Migration & SoD Failure (DEV Direct to PROD)</h2>

<div class="dialogue">

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">IT Auditor</span>
    <span class="tag">Planning</span><br>
    Can you walk me through how a change moves from DEV to PROD?
    Who is allowed to migrate changes into production?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Reality</span><br>
    I develop in DEV and sometimes push the release directly to PROD
    when we’re under time pressure. It’s faster.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">IT Auditor</span>
    <span class="tag">Control Risk</span><br>
    That breaks segregation of duties. If the same person develops and deploys,
    an unauthorized or untested change can reach production without detection.
    Do you have monitoring controls to reconcile actual PROD changes to approvals?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">IT Ops / Release Manager</span>
    <span class="tag">Gap</span><br>
    We don’t have a formal release manager role.
    Also, we don’t consistently reconcile PROD deployments against CAB approvals.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">IT Auditor</span>
    <span class="tag">Finding</span><br>
    Then the organization cannot confidently claim the change process is controlled or auditable.
    Remediation usually includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Remove developer write/deploy access to PROD (least privilege)</li>
      <li>Independent migration role (release/change manager) or automated pipeline with approvals</li>
      <li>Mandatory testing evidence before PROD promotion</li>
      <li>Detective control: monitor PROD and reconcile changes to approved tickets</li>
      <li>Required rollback/backout plans and post-implementation review for significant changes</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="subnote">
    <strong>Link to “식통감기”:</strong> DEV direct-to-PROD usually fails all four:
    weak <strong>Test</strong>, weak <strong>Control</strong>, weak <strong>Audit</strong>, and weak <strong>Record</strong>.
  </p>

</div>

<!-- ===================== Metrics / Health ===================== -->
<h2>Metrics to Judge Process Health</h2>

<p>
GTAG recommends using objective indicators (dashboards) to judge whether change management works.
Common examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Change success rate</strong> (changes not causing outages / service impairment)</li>
  <li><strong>Unauthorized change count</strong> (target should be zero)</li>
  <li><strong>Emergency change ratio</strong> (including emergency patches)</li>
  <li><strong>Patch latency</strong>: average time from vendor release to deployment</li>
  <li><strong>Unplanned work %</strong>: time spent on break/fix caused by failed changes</li>
</ul>

<!-- ===================== Discussion Questions ===================== -->
<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

<div class="questions">
<ul>
  <li>In your organization, what is the biggest weakness: <strong>Test</strong>, <strong>Control</strong>, <strong>Audit</strong>, or <strong>Record</strong>?</li>
  <li>Do developers have any way to deploy or modify configurations directly in PROD? If yes, what compensating controls exist?</li>
  <li>How do you ensure environments are “as identical as possible” (versions/patches/configs) before migration to PROD?</li>
  <li>How are patches handled: scheduled cycle vs ad hoc emergency? How do you handle vendor auto-push patches?</li>
  <li>What evidence would you show an auditor to prove that a change was properly approved, tested, and migrated?</li>
  <li>What metrics do you track today, and do they actually drive improvement (or just reporting)?</li>
</ul>
