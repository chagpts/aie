<h1>ITAC Risks at the Input Stage</h1>

<h2>AI OCR in Accounting Automation</h2>

<p>
[Study material for accounting professionals.  
Technical details are simplified for discussion purposes.]
</p>

<p>
Many companies now use <strong>AI-based OCR</strong> to read invoices
and automatically create journal entries in their accounting systems.
While this improves efficiency, it also introduces
<strong>new IT Application Control (ITAC) risks</strong>,
especially at the input stage.
</p>

<h2>Why the Input Stage Matters</h2>

<p>
The input stage includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Invoice upload</li>
  <li>OCR data extraction</li>
  <li>Document type classification</li>
</ul>

<p>
If data is incorrect at this stage,
downstream reviews may not detect the error.
This is why auditors often say:
</p>

<p><strong>“Garbage in, garbage out.”</strong></p>

<h2>Key Input-Stage Risks (ITAC Focus)</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Risk Area</th>
  <th>What Can Go Wrong</th>
  <th>Accounting Impact</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
  <td>OCR Recognition Errors</td>
  <td>
    Amount, date, vendor, tax, or currency

  </td>
  <td>
    Incorrect journal entries<br>
    Misstated expenses or liabilities
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Lack of Input Validation</td>
  <td>
    OCR data flows directly into ERP
    without logic checks
  </td>
  <td>
    Negative amounts or invalid tax postings
  </td>

<tr>
  <td>Source Document Integrity</td>
  <td>
    Uploaded documents can be modified
    or replaced without trace
  </td>
  <td>
    Unsupported or fraudulent entries
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Document Misclassification</td>
  <td>
    Invoice classified as credit memo<br>
    CapEx treated as OpEx
  </td>
  <td>
    Wrong account posting<br>
    EBITDA distortion
  </td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p class="note">
✔ Auditors expect controls such as OCR confidence thresholds,
mandatory human review, and document integrity checks.
</p>

<h2>Why Auditors Treat This as ITAC</h2>

<p>
These risks are considered ITAC because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Controls are embedded in the system</li>
  <li>Errors occur before human review</li>
  <li>Financial accuracy depends on system logic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Dialogue: Finance Lead vs. OCR Developer</h2>

<div class="dialogue">

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Accounting / Audit</span><br>
    We are using OCR to automatically read invoices and post entries into the ERP.
    From an audit perspective, my main concern is simple:
    <strong>how do we know the data going into the system is reliable?</strong>
    If the input is wrong, everything after that can also be wrong.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">System Flow</span><br>
    That makes sense. The OCR process has several steps.
    First, the invoice is uploaded.
    Then the system reads the text and tries to identify key fields like
    vendor name, invoice date, amount, and tax.
    For each field, the system also gives a <strong>confidence score</strong>,
    meaning how sure it is that the value is correct.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Risk Awareness</span><br>
    Confidence scores sound helpful, but from experience,
    I know that numbers can still look “reasonable” and be wrong.
    For example, the amount might be correct,
    but the tax could be missing or calculated incorrectly.
    Do we have any checks beyond just OCR confidence?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Basic Validation</span><br>
    Yes, we do.
    Before sending data to the ERP, the system runs basic validation rules.
    For example:
    <ul>
      <li>The total amount cannot be negative unless it is a credit note</li>
      <li>Tax amount must roughly match the net amount and tax rate</li>
      <li>The posting date must fall within an open accounting period</li>
      <li>The vendor must exist in the vendor master</li>
    </ul>
    If any of these checks fail, the invoice is stopped for manual review.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit Trail</span><br>
    That’s good. Another thing auditors always ask for is evidence.
    They want to see the <strong>original invoice</strong>,
    what the OCR system extracted,
    and whether anyone changed the data manually.
    Can we track all of that?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Traceability</span><br>
    Yes.
    The original invoice file is stored and cannot be overwritten.
    If someone edits an OCR result,
    the system records who changed it, when, and what was changed.
    The final data sent to the ERP is also saved,
    so we can always trace a journal entry back to the source document.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Controls & Roles</span><br>
    What about responsibilities?
    From a controls point of view,
    the person uploading an invoice should not be the same person approving it.
    Otherwise, we may have segregation of duties issues.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">User Roles</span><br>
    We thought about that as well.
    The system separates roles:
    one user uploads invoices,
    another reviews OCR results,
    and a different user approves posting to the ERP.
    The system does not allow one person to do all steps alone.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Classification Risk</span><br>
    I’m also concerned about document type.
    If an invoice is mistakenly treated as a credit memo,
    or if capital expenditure is treated as an expense,
    that directly affects financial reporting.
    How do we reduce that risk?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Practical Safeguards</span><br>
    For high-risk cases, the system is more conservative.
    If the document type is unclear,
    or the amount is unusually high,
    the invoice is automatically sent for manual review.
    We also regularly review errors and adjust the rules
    so the system improves over time.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Conclusion</span><br>
    That helps a lot.
    From an audit perspective,
    as long as we can show
    <strong>input checks, clear approval steps, and a full audit trail</strong>,
    auditors are more likely to accept OCR as a controlled process
    rather than a black box.
  </p>

  <p class="subnote">
    ✔ This type of conversation reflects how companies typically explain
    OCR-related controls to auditors:
    focusing less on complex technology
    and more on practical risks, checks, and responsibilities.
