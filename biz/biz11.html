<h1>ITAC Risks at the Input Stage</h1>

<h2>AI OCR in Accounting Automation</h2>

<p>
[Study material for accounting professionals.  
Technical details are simplified for discussion purposes.]
</p>

<p>
Many companies now use <strong>AI-based OCR</strong> to read invoices
and automatically create journal entries in their accounting systems.
While this improves efficiency, it also introduces
<strong>new IT Application Control (ITAC) risks</strong>,
especially at the input stage.
</p>

<!-- ===================== Added Section: AI OCR Overview ===================== -->
<h2>What Is AI OCR?</h2>

<p>
<strong>AI OCR</strong> is “intelligent document reading.”
Traditional OCR mainly converts images into text.
AI OCR goes further by using ML/AI to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Understand layouts</strong> (tables, headers, line items, stamps, signatures)</li>
  <li><strong>Classify documents</strong> (invoice vs. receipt vs. credit memo)</li>
  <li><strong>Extract key fields</strong> (vendor, invoice date, total, VAT, currency, bank info)</li>
  <li><strong>Validate and normalize</strong> (date formats, currency symbols, tax formats)</li>
</ul>

<div class="badges">
  <span class="badge">Text recognition</span>
  <span class="badge">Layout understanding</span>
  <span class="badge">Field extraction</span>
  <span class="badge">Document classification</span>
  <span class="badge">Confidence scoring</span>
</div>

<h2>Types of OCR (and Where AI OCR Fits)</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>How It Works</th>
  <th>Strengths</th>
  <th>Limitations</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Rule-based OCR</strong><br>(Template OCR)</td>
  <td>Fixed coordinates or templates per vendor/layout</td>
  <td>High accuracy for known formats, predictable</td>
  <td>Breaks when layout changes; scaling vendors is hard</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Traditional OCR</strong><br>(Generic text OCR)</td>
  <td>Converts image → text (no deep understanding)</td>
  <td>Good for clean scans & simple text blocks</td>
  <td>Weak on tables/line items; needs heavy post-processing</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>AI OCR</strong><br>(Document AI / IDP)</td>
  <td>ML models detect structure + extract fields + classify docs</td>
  <td>Works across many formats, handles tables better</td>
  <td>Still error-prone; requires monitoring & governance</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Hybrid OCR</strong></td>
  <td>AI OCR + rules (validation, vendor-specific tweaks)</td>
  <td>Best practical approach in accounting</td>
  <td>Needs control design; rules can drift over time</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Key Characteristics of AI OCR</h2>

<div class="mini-card">
  <h3>1) Confidence Score (But It’s Not a Guarantee)</h3>
  <p>
    AI OCR typically outputs a <strong>confidence score</strong> for each field (e.g., total amount 0.92).
    This helps automation—but confidence can be misleading when the model is “confidently wrong.”
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Best practice: threshold rules (e.g., &lt;0.90 → mandatory review)</li>
    <li>Different thresholds per field: amount/VAT should be stricter than description</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mini-card">
  <h3>2) Layout & Table Understanding</h3>
  <p>
    AI OCR can parse tables and line items, but errors increase when:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scans are skewed/blurred</li>
    <li>Tables have merged cells or inconsistent columns</li>
    <li>Multiple totals exist (subtotal / total / amount due)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mini-card">
  <h3>3) Continuous Drift</h3>
  <p>
    Vendors change invoice formats, and the model’s performance can drift.
    Governance matters: periodic sampling, exception tracking, and vendor-format monitoring.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Typical Problems & Risks with AI OCR</h2>

  <th>Problem</th>
  <th>What It Looks Like</th>
  <th>Accounting Risk</th>
  <th>Control Ideas</th>

</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
  <td><strong>“Confidently wrong” extraction</strong></td>
  <td>Total picked from subtotal; VAT read incorrectly</td>
  <td>Misstatement in expenses/tax</td>
  <td>3-way checks (line total = sum), VAT logic rules, field thresholds</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Duplicate / missing invoices</strong></td>
  <td>Same invoice uploaded twice; missing page</td>
  <td>Overstatement or incomplete liabilities</td>
  <td>Duplicate detection (vendor+invoice# + amount), page count checks</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Document misclassification</strong></td>
  <td>Credit memo treated as invoice</td>
  <td>Wrong direction of posting</td>
  <td>Doc-type validation, negative amount logic, human review triggers</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Poor scan quality</strong></td>
  <td>Blur, shadow, skew, handwritten notes</td>
  <td>Higher error rate and manual rework</td>
  <td>Upload quality gate; reject/flag low-quality scans</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Security / privacy leakage</strong></td>
  <td>PII/bank info sent to external OCR service</td>
  <td>Compliance breach</td>
  <td>Data masking, vendor due diligence, encryption, retention policies</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><strong>Model updates change behavior</strong></td>
  <td>Accuracy drops after vendor release</td>
  <td>Control failure if unmonitored</td>
  <td>Change management, regression testing, monitoring dashboards</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Audit reality:</strong> “AI” does not reduce control needs.  
  It often <strong>increases</strong> the need for evidence: thresholds, sampling, exception logs, and change management.
</div>

<h2>Why Use AI OCR in Accounting (Benefits)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> faster invoice processing and shorter month-end close</li>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> reduces repetitive data entry workload</li>
  <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> normalizes vendor formats into consistent ERP fields</li>
  <li><strong>Better controls (when designed well):</strong> automated validations can be stronger than manual keying</li>
  <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> dashboards for exceptions, aging, and processing bottlenecks</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
✔ The best results usually come from a <strong>hybrid approach</strong>:
AI OCR + validation rules + human review for low-confidence/high-risk items.
</p>
<!-- =================== End Added Section: AI OCR Overview =================== -->

<h2>Why the Input Stage Matters</h2>

<p>
The input stage includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Invoice upload</li>
  <li>OCR data extraction</li>
  <li>Document type classification</li>
</ul>

<p>
If data is incorrect at this stage,
downstream reviews may not detect the error.
This is why auditors often say:
</p>

<p><strong>“Garbage in, garbage out.”</strong></p>

<h2>Key Input-Stage Risks (ITAC Focus)</h2>

<table>

  <th>Risk Area</th>
  <th>What Can Go Wrong</th>
  <th>Accounting Impact</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
  <td>OCR Recognition Errors</td>
  <td>
    Amount, date, vendor, tax, or currency
    is misread by OCR
  </td>
  <td>
    Incorrect journal entries<br>
    Misstated expenses or liabilities
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Lack of Input Validation</td>
  <td>
    OCR data flows directly into ERP
    without logic checks
  </td>
  <td>
    Negative amounts or invalid tax postings
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Source Document Integrity</td>

    Uploaded documents can be modified
    or replaced without trace
  </td>
  <td>
    Unsupported or fraudulent entries
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Document Misclassification</td>
  <td>
    Invoice classified as credit memo<br>
    CapEx treated as OpEx
  </td>
  <td>
    Wrong account posting<br>
    EBITDA distortion
  </td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p class="note">
✔ Auditors expect controls such as OCR confidence thresholds,
mandatory human review, and document integrity checks.
</p>

<h2>Why Auditors Treat This as ITAC</h2>

<p>
These risks are considered ITAC because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Controls are embedded in the system</li>
  <li>Errors occur before human review</li>
  <li>Financial accuracy depends on system logic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Dialogue: Finance Lead vs. OCR Developer</h2>

<div class="dialogue">

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit Concern</span><br>
    I’d like to focus on a different risk today.
    My main concern is <strong>document integrity</strong>.
    Once an invoice is uploaded into the system,
    how can we be sure that it is not replaced or modified later
    without anyone noticing?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Current Risk</span><br>
    That’s an important point.
    If there are no controls after upload,
    there is a risk that a document could be changed later
    while still looking valid in the system.
    From a system perspective,
    it can be difficult to prove that the file was altered.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit Reality</span><br>
    Exactly.
    Auditors usually ask very straightforward questions, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Can the uploaded document be replaced?</li>
      <li>If it is changed, can the system detect it?</li>
      <li>How do we know the reviewed invoice is the same one that was posted?</li>
    </ul>
    If we cannot clearly answer these,
    they often see it as a control failure.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Basic Control Idea</span><br>
    One common way to address this is to create a
    <strong>digital fingerprint</strong> of the document at upload.
    This fingerprint is called a <strong>hash</strong>.
    If the document changes later,
    the fingerprint also changes,
    which makes the modification detectable.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Simple Example</span><br>
    Let me give a simple example using <strong>MD5</strong>.
    When an invoice is uploaded,
    the system calculates a hash like this:
    <br><br>
    <code>
      Original file MD5: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
    </code>
    <br><br>
    If even a small part of the file is changed,
    the MD5 value will be completely different.
    A mismatch clearly shows that
    <strong>the document is no longer identical to the original upload</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Follow-up Question</span><br>
    That example is easy to understand.
    But auditors sometimes ask,
    “Why are you using MD5?”
    They often recommend <strong>SHA-256</strong> instead.
    Why does that matter?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit-Friendly Explanation</span><br>
    MD5 is good for detecting basic or accidental changes,
    but it is considered <strong>weak by today’s standards</strong>.
    In rare cases,
    two different files can end up with the same MD5 value.
    Because of that risk,
    auditors usually prefer <strong>SHA-256</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Why SHA-256</span><br>
    SHA-256 creates a much stronger digital fingerprint.
    In practical terms, this means:
    <ul>
      <li>It is much harder for two different files to share the same hash</li>
      <li>It provides stronger evidence that the document was not tampered with</li>
      <li>Auditors are more comfortable relying on it as a control</li>
    </ul>
    So while both MD5 and SHA-256 can detect changes,
    <strong>SHA-256 gives higher assurance</strong>
    when document integrity is critical.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Prevention</span><br>
    Detection is important,
    but auditors also ask about prevention.
    Can the document be locked
    so it cannot be changed after upload?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Read-Only Control</span><br>
    Yes.
    A common approach is to make the document
    <strong>read-only after upload</strong>.
    Users can view the invoice,
    but they cannot overwrite or replace the original file.
    If a correction is needed,
    a new document must be uploaded instead.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Version History</span><br>
    And when a new document is uploaded,
    auditors usually want to see a clear history.
    They ask questions like:
    “Which version was used for posting?”
    “Who uploaded the new version?”
    “Why was the change made?”
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Versioning & Logs</span><br>
    That’s handled through <strong>document versioning</strong>
    and <strong>change logs</strong>.
    Each upload becomes a new version.
    The system records who uploaded it and when,
    and the original document is never deleted.
    The accounting entry clearly links
    to the specific document version that was used.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit Conclusion</span><br>
    From an audit perspective,
    this is exactly what we need.
    If we can show that:
    <ul>
      <li>Documents cannot be silently changed</li>
      <li>Any change creates a new version</li>
      <li>Hashes like SHA-256 are used to detect tampering</li>
    </ul>
    auditors are much more comfortable
    relying on the system as a controlled process.
  </p>

  <p class="subnote">
    ✔ In many audits, document integrity controls
    (hashing, read-only access, version history, and change logs)
    are considered more critical than OCR accuracy itself.
