<h1>ITAC Risks at the Input Stage</h1>

<h2>AI OCR in Accounting Automation</h2>

<p>
[Study material for accounting professionals.  
Technical details are simplified for discussion purposes.]
</p>

<p>
Many companies now use <strong>AI-based OCR</strong> to read invoices
and automatically create journal entries in their accounting systems.
While this improves efficiency, it also introduces
<strong>new IT Application Control (ITAC) risks</strong>,
especially at the input stage.
</p>

<h2>Why the Input Stage Matters</h2>

<p>
The input stage includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Invoice upload</li>
  <li>OCR data extraction</li>
  <li>Document type classification</li>
</ul>

<p>
If data is incorrect at this stage,
downstream reviews may not detect the error.
This is why auditors often say:
</p>

<p><strong>“Garbage in, garbage out.”</strong></p>

<h2>Key Input-Stage Risks (ITAC Focus)</h2>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Risk Area</th>
  <th>What Can Go Wrong</th>
  <th>Accounting Impact</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
  <td>OCR Recognition Errors</td>
  <td>
    Amount, date, vendor, tax, or currency
    is misread by OCR
  </td>
  <td>
    Incorrect journal entries<br>
    Misstated expenses or liabilities
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Lack of Input Validation</td>
  <td>
    OCR data flows directly into ERP
    without logic checks
  </td>
  <td>
    Negative amounts or invalid tax postings
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Source Document Integrity</td>
  <td>
    Uploaded documents can be modified
    or replaced without trace
  </td>
  <td>
    Unsupported or fraudulent entries
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Document Misclassification</td>
  <td>
    Invoice classified as credit memo<br>
    CapEx treated as OpEx
  </td>
  <td>
    Wrong account posting<br>
    EBITDA distortion
  </td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p class="note">
✔ Auditors expect controls such as OCR confidence thresholds,
mandatory human review, and document integrity checks.
</p>

<h2>Why Auditors Treat This as ITAC</h2>

<p>
These risks are considered ITAC because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Controls are embedded in the system</li>
  <li>Errors occur before human review</li>
  <li>Financial accuracy depends on system logic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Dialogue: Finance Lead vs. OCR Developer</h2>

<div class="dialogue">

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit Concern</span><br>
    I want to shift the discussion a bit.
    My biggest concern is not only OCR accuracy,
    but <strong>the integrity of the original invoice itself</strong>.
    Once a document is uploaded,
    how can we be sure it was not replaced or altered later?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Current Setup</span><br>
    At the moment, users upload invoice files into the system,
    and the OCR process runs on that file.
    However, I agree that if we do not control what happens
    <em>after</em> upload, there is a risk.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit Reality</span><br>
    Exactly.
    Auditors often ask very direct questions, like:
    <ul>
      <li>Can the uploaded document be replaced?</li>
      <li>If it is changed, can we detect it?</li>
      <li>How do we know the invoice reviewed is the same one that was posted?</li>
    </ul>
    If we cannot answer these clearly,
    they see it as a serious control weakness.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Risk Explanation</span><br>
    That makes sense.
    Without proper controls,
    someone could theoretically upload one invoice,
    let it pass approval,
    and then replace the file with a different one later.
    From the system’s point of view,
    it would be hard to prove that a change happened.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Key Audit Questions</span><br>
    Right.
    Auditors usually ask whether we use things like:
    <strong>hash values or checksums</strong>,
    whether the document becomes <strong>read-only after upload</strong>,
    and whether there is any <strong>version control or change history</strong>.
    If the answer is “no” to all three,
    they get very uncomfortable.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Simple Controls</span><br>
    To address that,
    we can introduce some basic but effective controls.
    First, when a document is uploaded,
    the system can generate a <strong>digital fingerprint</strong>
    (for example, a hash value).
    If the file is changed later,
    the fingerprint will no longer match.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Practical Impact</span><br>
    That’s helpful,
    because then we can show auditors
    that the invoice used for posting
    is exactly the same file that was originally uploaded.
    What about preventing changes in the first place?
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Prevention</span><br>
    A common approach is to make the document
    <strong>read-only after upload</strong>.
    Users can still view and reference it,
    but they cannot overwrite or replace the original file.
    If a correction is needed,
    a new document must be uploaded instead.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Version History</span><br>
    And if a new document is uploaded,
    auditors usually want to see a clear trail.
    They ask questions like:
    “Which version was used?”
    “Why was it changed?”
    “Who approved the change?”
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">OCR Developer</span>
    <span class="tag">Change Tracking</span><br>
    That’s where <strong>document versioning</strong> and
    <strong>change logs</strong> come in.
    Each upload becomes a new version,
    and the system records who uploaded it and when.
    The original file is never deleted,
    and the posting record clearly points to
    the specific version that was used.
  </p>

  <p class="msg">
    <span class="role">Finance Lead</span>
    <span class="tag">Audit Conclusion</span><br>
    From an audit perspective,
    that is exactly what we need.
    If we can demonstrate that:
    <ul>
      <li>The original document cannot be silently changed</li>
      <li>Any change creates a new version</li>
      <li>All changes are logged and reviewable</li>
    </ul>
    then auditors are much more comfortable relying on the system.
  </p>

  <p class="subnote">
    ✔ In audit discussions, document integrity controls are often
    more important than OCR accuracy itself.
    Being able to prove that source documents are protected,
    traceable, and unchanged is a key IT application control.
  </p>
