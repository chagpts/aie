<h1>ITGC English Study</h1>
<p><strong>Topic:</strong> System Development & Implementation (Initiation Phase)</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1. Warm-up & ITGC Overview</h2>

    <h3>Icebreaker Discussion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Have you ever been involved in a system implementation or ERP project?</li>
        <li>What usually goes wrong in system implementation projects?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key ITGC Concepts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>IT General Controls (ITGC)</li>
        <li>System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</li>
        <li>Initiation Phase</li>
        <li>Governance and approval</li>
        <li>Investment performance evaluation</li>
        <li>Project Management Office (PMO)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Why is the initiation phase critical from an audit perspective?</li>
        <li>What risks arise when management approval is weak or informal?</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Control 1.1.1</h2>

    <p><strong>Control Statement:</strong><br>
    New system implementation should be approved through appropriate review and approval procedures.</p>

    <h3>Audit Objective</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure that new information systems are implemented based on formal review,
        business justification, and management approval.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Risks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Systems implemented without clear business justification</li>
        <li>Absence of investment performance or ROI evaluation</li>
        <li>Vendor selection based on relationships rather than capability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interview Practice (Role Play)</h3>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Thank you for your time today. I’d like to ask a few questions regarding the approval process for the new system implementation.</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Sure. I’ll do my best to explain.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> First, is there a formal policy for approving new system implementations?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes. We have an IT investment and system approval policy. Any new system requires a formal review and approval before the project starts.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Who has the authority to approve a new system under that policy?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> The final approval is granted by the executive committee, including the CIO and CFO. For large projects, board-level approval is also required.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Was an investment performance evaluation conducted before this system was approved?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes. We prepared a business case that included expected cost savings, efficiency improvements, and estimated return on investment.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Was that evaluation documented and formally reviewed?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes, it was documented and reviewed during the approval meeting. The results were included in the approval materials.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Did management review benchmarking materials or case studies from other companies?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes. We reviewed implementation cases from several large companies in the same industry, including both successful and unsuccessful projects.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> How was the vendor selected, and was prior experience with large enterprises considered?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> We conducted a vendor evaluation process. The vendor was selected based on technical capability, project methodology, and experience implementing similar systems for large enterprises.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Were those evaluation results documented and approved?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes. The evaluation results and selection rationale were documented and approved as part of the procurement process.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Thank you. We will review the related documents to confirm what we discussed today.</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> No problem. Please let me know if you need any additional information.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Document Review Practice</h3>
    <div class="box">
        <strong>Documents to review:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Policy for IT investment and system approval</li>
            <li>Management or board approval records</li>
            <li>Business case or ROI analysis documents</li>
            <li>Vendor selection and evaluation materials</li>
            <li>Contract approval documents</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Discussion points:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Which documents clearly demonstrate management approval?</li>
            <li>What evidence would be considered insufficient for audit purposes?</li>
            <li>Is post-implementation evaluation required under ITGC?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. Control 1.1.2</h2>

    <p><strong>Control Statement:</strong><br>
    Effective governance and communication structures should exist during system development.</p>

    <h3>Audit Objective</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure that appropriate governance and communication mechanisms are established
        to support effective system development.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Why is a PMO important from an audit perspective?</li>
        <li>What risks exist if business users are not involved in the project?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interview Practice</h3>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Thank you for meeting with us. I’d like to ask a few questions about the governance structure during the system implementation project.</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Sure. Please go ahead.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Was a PMO or steering committee established for the project?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes. A formal PMO was established at the beginning of the project, and a steering committee was also formed for major decisions.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> What was the role of the PMO in the project?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> The PMO was responsible for project planning, progress monitoring, issue tracking, and coordination among departments.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> How were issues, risks, and key decisions escalated during the project?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Operational issues were handled by the project team, while major risks and decisions were escalated to the steering committee through regular status meetings.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Were all relevant departments involved in the project?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes. The project included representatives from IT, accounting, finance, and internal control, as well as key business users.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> How were roles and responsibilities defined?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Roles and responsibilities were clearly defined in a RACI matrix and documented in the project governance charter.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Can you provide evidence such as meeting minutes or governance documents?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Yes. We have PMO meeting minutes, steering committee materials, and the project governance documents available for review.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Who had the final decision-making authority for the project?</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Final decision-making authority rested with the steering committee, chaired by the CIO, with approval from the CFO for financial matters.</p>

        <p><span class="label">Auditor:</span> Thank you. We will review the documents and follow up if we have additional questions.</p>
        <p><span class="label">Manager:</span> Of course. Please let us know if anything else is needed.</p>

    <h2>4. Audit Simulation Exercise</h2>

    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
    A company implemented a new accounting system in the prior year.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <strong>Provided evidence:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>No formal ROI or investment performance analysis</li>
            <li>Vendor selected primarily based on prior relationships</li>
            <li>PMO existed, but meeting minutes were not retained</li>
            <li>Approval obtained via email only, without formal sign-off</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Group tasks:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify control deficiencies</li>
            <li>Assess control effectiveness (effective, partially effective, ineffective)</li>
            <li>Draft audit findings in English</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Example audit finding:</strong><br>
    The company did not perform a formal investment performance evaluation prior to system implementation,
    increasing the risk that the system may not align with business objectives.
